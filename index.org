Watched Let's Play of Night in the Woods 2 times over. One on Jackscepticeye's channel 2 years ago and one by ManlyBadassHero last year. Only got around to playing it now. Doesn't matter too much as I've basically forgotten everything by now.

Even if you /know/ the story and what happens, you will never /understand/ the story unless you get to experience it yourself i.e *playing the goddamn game yourself*.
