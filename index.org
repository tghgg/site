# BEGIN_BODY

Coded seriously for the first time without auto-completion today, mostly because I couldn't set up Emacs properly for C# at work. It's certainly a unique experience. No more nagging for autocompletion, no more red squiggly lines, no more distractions from the tiny details so you can focus on the overall structure of the program. Doing it like this feels like a new yet immeasurably old workflow, one that has been lost to time due to the rise of Intellisense.
